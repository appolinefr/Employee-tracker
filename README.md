## Description of Project

This challenge was to build a command-line application from scratch to manage a company's employee database, using Node.js, Inquirer, and MySQL.

## Project Requirements

Here are the main requirements of the project:

- When I start the application then I am presented with the following options: view all departments, view all roles, view all employees, add a department, add a role, add an employee, and update an employee role
- When I choose to view all departments then I am presented with a formatted table showing department names and department ids
- When I choose to view all roles thenI am presented with the job title, role id, the department that role belongs to, and the salary for that role
- When I choose to view all employees then I am presented with a formatted table showing employee data, including employee ids, first names, last names, job titles, departments, salaries, and managers that the employees report to
- When I choose to add a department then I am prompted to enter the name of the department and that department is added to the database
- When I choose to add a role I am prompted to enter the name, salary, and department for the role and that role is added to the database
- When I choose to add an employee then I am prompted to enter the employeeâ€™s first name, last name, role, and manager, and that employee is added to the database
- When I choose to update an employee role then I am prompted to select an employee to update and their new role and this information is updated in the database

## What I have learned

Working on this challenge allowed me to consolidate my SQL knowledge. I now have a better understanding of prepared statements and asynchronous functions. MySQL is a great tool and it has been quite intuitive to learn its synthax and features.

## Challenges

Extracting informations from the tables of the database was challenging at times but with the help of the documentation I was successful in manipulating the database.
